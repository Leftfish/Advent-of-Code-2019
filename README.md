# Advent of Code 2019

So once again I tried to find out how far I can make it in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/). After tapping out in 2018 after 9 days, I decided try to beat this score in 2019 - and I did. 

I managed to solve the first 13 days, which included writing a fully functional intcode computer. Then my regular professional life won and prevented me from getting deeply involved into graph-related problems. Dijkstras, BFSs and DFSs of the world will have to wait for next year :)
